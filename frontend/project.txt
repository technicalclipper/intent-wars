ü™Ñ Project Title: Intent Alchemy ‚Äì Brew Your DeFi Potions
üåå Concept Overview

Intent Alchemy is a gamified DeFi experience built on Avail Nexus SDK, where players become on-chain alchemists who craft DeFi strategies as magical potions.

Instead of manually executing complex multi-chain DeFi actions, players drag and drop ‚ÄúSpell Cards‚Äù ‚Äî such as Bridge, Swap, Lend, and Borrow ‚Äî into a Brewing Cauldron to visually design and simulate strategies.

The backend uses Nexus SDK for real cross-chain bridging and simulation, and displays potion results like Efficiency, Yield, and Gas Cost.
Players can then execute their potion or challenge others in PvP battles, where the most efficient strategy wins.

‚öóÔ∏è Gameplay Flow
1. Intent Playground (Solo Mode)

The player starts in a mystical workshop (dark UI, floating runes, glowing particles).

Left Panel: Spell Card Library (Bridge, Swap, Lend, Borrow)

Center: Brewing Cauldron Area (drag & connect spell cards)

Right Panel: Spell Configuration (Chain, Token, Amount inputs)

üß© Flow:

Player drags Spell Cards into the cauldron (visual pipeline).

Each card opens a small popup to select parameters.

Player clicks Simulate Brew.

Backend runs Nexus SDK or mock simulation functions.

Potion animation plays ‚Üí glowing cauldron, magical particles.

Simulation result displayed as Potion Report Card.

üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 2. Spell Cards (MVP Set)
Spell	Name	Function	Params	Backend Function
üåÄ Bridge Spell	The Portal Elixir	Moves tokens between chains	From Chain, To Chain, Token, Amount	sdk.bridge()
‚ú® Swap Spell	The Transmutation Brew	Converts one token to another (simulated/custom)	Chain, Token In, Token Out, Amount	simulateSwap() or custom liquidity contract
üíé Lend Spell	The Prosperity Infusion	Supplies tokens for yield (simulated APY)	Chain, Token, Amount	simulateLend()
üîÆ Borrow Spell	The Risky Ritual	Borrows tokens using collateral	Chain, Collateral, Token, Ratio	simulateBorrow()
üí° MVP Decks for Implementation (Phase 1)

‚úÖ Bridge Spell (real SDK integration)
‚úÖ Swap Spell (simulated or custom liquidity contract)
üß™ Lend Spell (simulated yield logic)
üö´ Borrow Spell (Phase 2 feature)

üß™ 3. Simulation Phase (First Brew)
Flow:

The front-end collects all spell configurations into JSON:

{
  "player": "0xUser",
  "spells": [
    { "type": "bridge", "from": "Sepolia", "to": "Polygon", "token": "ETH", "amount": 0.5 },
    { "type": "swap", "chain": "Polygon", "from": "ETH", "to": "USDC", "amount": 0.5 }
  ]
}


Backend receives recipe and runs:

simulateBridge() ‚Üí get gas estimate

simulateSwap() ‚Üí get price impact, output tokens

Computes:

yield = (output_value - input_value) / input_value
efficiency = yield / gas_cost


Returns Potion Result:

‚úÖ Strategy simulated successfully  
üí∞ Estimated Yield: +1.8%  
‚õΩ Gas Cost: $0.82  
‚ö° Efficiency Score: 91/100

‚öôÔ∏è 4. Execution Phase (Potion Brew Execution)

If the player clicks ‚ÄúBrew for Real‚Äù:

Calls actual sdk.bridge() or sdk.bridgeAndExecute() from Nexus SDK.

On success:

Potion bottle glows brightly.

Stored in player‚Äôs Potion Collection (Dashboard) with metrics.

Each potion represents a completed on-chain strategy.

‚öîÔ∏è 5. PvP Mode (1v1 Battle Arena)

After brewing, players can enter Alchemy Arena for PvP battles.
Two potions (strategies) are compared on Efficiency, Yield, and Gas Cost.

‚öôÔ∏è PvP Technical Implementation (Async PvP System)

To keep it simple for MVP, we use Asynchronous PvP (turn-based).
Both players brew separately; backend compares results when both are done.

üß± Backend Tech Stack

Node.js + Express (server)

PostgreSQL / MongoDB (store users, matches, and potion data)

Socket.io (optional) for live update layer

Nexus SDK for simulation/execution

üß† PvP Flow
1. Matchmaking

Player A clicks ‚ÄúFind Match‚Äù.

Backend checks DB:

If no player waiting ‚Üí add Player A to waiting queue.

If Player B available ‚Üí pair them:

{
  "matchId": "M123",
  "players": ["playerA", "playerB"],
  "status": "active",
  "task": "Maximize yield with 50 USDC across chains"
}


Both get the same task + matchId.

2. Brew & Submit

Each player crafts and simulates their potion.
Frontend sends:

{
  "matchId": "M123",
  "player": "playerA",
  "potion": {
    "spells": [
      { "type": "bridge", "from": "Sepolia", "to": "Polygon", "token": "ETH" },
      { "type": "swap", "chain": "Polygon", "from": "ETH", "to": "USDC" }
    ],
    "efficiency": 91,
    "yield": 1.8,
    "gas": 0.82
  }
}


Backend stores it and waits for both players.

3. Match Resolution

When both submissions arrive:

Compare both potion results:

if (playerA.efficiency > playerB.efficiency) winner = "playerA";
else winner = "playerB";


Store results:

{
  "matchId": "M123",
  "winner": "playerA",
  "summary": {
    "playerA": { "efficiency": 91, "yield": 1.8, "gas": 0.82 },
    "playerB": { "efficiency": 85, "yield": 1.6, "gas": 0.79 }
  }
}


Notify both players via REST or Socket event.

4. Frontend PvP Animation

Two potion bottles appear on screen.

Colors swirl and collide.

Winner potion glows & sparkles.

Result shown:

üèÜ Player A Wins!
Efficiency: 91 vs 85
Yield: +1.8%
Gas Cost: $0.82
